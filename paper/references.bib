abstract = {Last year I wrote about the important challenge of staying one step ahead of invalid traffic in the audience measurement business. Today, I'm hoping to re-visit the subject and help further explain the impact of some forms of invalid, non-user initiated traffic. Audiences and impressions form the basis for the monetization of digital media, and it is paramount that what we measure reflect the behavior of actual persons and not of bots or other forms of non-human traffic (NHT). It is a responsibility we at comScore take very seriously.},
